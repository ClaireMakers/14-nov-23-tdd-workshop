red green refactor

- Writing test cases first and then writing code based on your test cases

- You know what outcomes you need from the code - helps you make design/plannning decisions

- It allows you to work on your code in small chunks - building up bit by bit, test after test

- Makes the software scalable - more complex software without losing functionality - it's easy
to add new functionality to pre-tested software and scale it up little by little.
